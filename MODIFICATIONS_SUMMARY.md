## New Data Structure

### API Response Changes
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "totalResumes": 10,
    "matchedResumes": 6,
    "unmatchedResumes": 4,
    "averageScore": 7.2,
    "highestScore": 9.1,
    "lowestScore": 6.0
  },
  "matchedResults": [...],  // Only resumes with score ≥ 6
  "unmatchedResults": [...], // Resumes with score < 6
  "jobDescription": "..."
}
```

### Resume Result Changes
```json
{
  "resumeName": "original-name.pdf",
  "newResumeName": "user_GoogleInc_SeniorSoftwareEngineer_123456",
  "companyName": "Google Inc",
  "roleName": "Senior Software Engineer",
  "matchStatus": "MATCHED",
  "atsScore": [8.5],
  // ... other existing fields
}
```

## New Resume Naming Convention

### Format: `Username_CompanyName_RoleName_ID`
- **Username**: Extracted from the first line of the resume (e.g., "Saikrishna")
- **CompanyName**: Extracted from Excel Column A (cleaned of special characters)
- **RoleName**: Extracted from Excel Column B (cleaned of special characters)
- **ID**: 6-digit timestamp-based unique identifier

### Examples:
- `Saikrishna_Markforged_SoftwareEngineerII_123456`
- `Saikrishna_Microsoft_DataScientist_789012`
- `Saikrishna_Apple_ProductManager_345678`

### Important Note:
**Only the best match resume for each job description gets renamed.** This means:
- If a resume scores highest for a specific job description, it gets the new name
- Other resumes (even if they score ≥ 6) keep their original names
- This ensures you only have one renamed file per job opening for the top candidate

## AI Prompt Changes

### New Section Added:
```
3. Job Details
Company: [Extract the company name from the job description]
Role: [Extract the job title/role from the job description]
Match Status: [Write 'MATCHED' if score >= 6, otherwise write 'UNMATCHED']
```

### Updated Section Numbering:
- Section 1: Career Summary
- Section 2: ATS Score
- Section 3: Job Details (NEW)
- Section 4: Strengths and Weaknesses
- Section 5: Suggestions to improve
- Section A: Work Experience
- Section B: Certificates
- Section C: Projects
- Section D: Technical Skills

## Excel Export Enhancements

### New Columns Added:
1. Job Description
2. Best Match Resume
3. ATS Score
4. **New Resume Name** (NEW)
5. **Company** (NEW) - Extracted from Excel Column A
6. **Role** (NEW) - Extracted from Excel Column B
7. **Match Status** (NEW)
8. File Size

### Excel Input Format (Updated):
The system now expects a **3-column Excel format**:
- **Column A**: Company Name
- **Column B**: Job Role/Title  
- **Column C**: Job Description

This format provides more accurate resume renaming since company and role information comes directly from your Excel columns rather than being extracted by AI from description text.

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the Spring Boot application**
2. **Open `test-modified-api.html`** in a web browser
3. **Test each mode** to verify functionality:
   - Mode 2: Single resume analysis with company/role extraction
   - Mode 3: Bulk resume analysis with filtering and renaming
   - Mode 4: Bulk JD analysis with comprehensive results
4. **Check the results** for:
   - New resume names in format `user_companyname_role_ID`
   - Company and role information extracted from job descriptions
   - Only matched resumes (score ≥ 6) displayed
   - Enhanced Excel export with new columns

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Better Organization**: Resumes are automatically renamed based on job context
2. **Improved Filtering**: Users only see relevant, matched resumes
3. **Enhanced Analytics**: Company and role information provides better insights
4. **Professional Output**: Standardized naming convention for better file management
5. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Excel exports include all relevant matching information

## Notes

- **Score Threshold**: Currently set to 6.0 for "matched" status (configurable)
- **Fallback Values**: Uses "Unknown Company" and "Unknown Role" if extraction fails
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality remains intact
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for parsing failures
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on processing speed
